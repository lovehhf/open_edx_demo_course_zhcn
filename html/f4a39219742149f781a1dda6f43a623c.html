Click on it now, and you will see how you're doing in this demo course.</p>

Further down the page is a detailed breakdown of your score on every graded question in the class.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4c4c4c;">You might notice that some of your assignments on the bar chart show an 'x'. The 'x's indicate the assignments that the edX system will NOT be counting toward your final grade, according to the course grading. The 'x's go to the assignments that you scored the lowest on. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #4c4c4c;">Each course has its own percentage cutoff for a Certificate of Mastery. You can see where those cutoffs are by looking at the vertical description. In this demo, a "pass" is considered 60%. When you "pass" a live edX course, you will receive a certificate after the class has closed. Sorry - the demo course does not grant certificates!</p>
