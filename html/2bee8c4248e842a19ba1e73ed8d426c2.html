<h2>Labs and Demos</h2>
<p><img src="/static/labs_x250.png" alt="Labs" width="250" hspace="12" vspace="12" border="0" align="right" />Professors that create courses on edX are able to implement highly interactive experiences that allow you as a student to experiment using easy to use online web applications.
