Some students and professors also engage through other social mediums like Meetup or Facebook.</p>
<p>Recent research has found that if you take a class with a friend, or engage socially with other learners while taking a course, there is a higher likelihood that you will complete a course. If you haven&rsquo;t already, consider finding a study buddy!</p>

<p>In the discussion forums, remember to be polite and respectful. Simply put, treat others the way you want to be treated.</p>
